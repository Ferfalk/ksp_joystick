## USB Joystick for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) using D400B-M4 and Arduino Pro Micro

This project allows you to use a custom-built USB joystick for **Kerbal Space Program** (KSP) by interfacing a **D400B-M4** joystick with an **Arduino Pro Micro**. The joystick can be mapped to control various in-game axes (such as pitch, yaw, and roll) along with a button for quick commands.

### Key Features:

- Uses an **Arduino Pro Micro** for USB HID support.
- Interfaces with the **D400B-M4** joystick for analog input axes (X, Y, Rz) and a button.
- Includes deadzone handling for smoother controls.
- Fully configurable for other games or applications using HID joystick input.

### Installation:

1. Open the project in **VSCode** with **PlatformIO**.
2. Connect the **D400B-M4** joystick to the appropriate analog and digital pins on the **Arduino**:
   - X-axis to **A0**
   - Y-axis to **A1**
   - Rz-axis to **A2**
   - Button to **Digital Pin 2**
3. Upload the provided code to your **Arduino Pro Micro**.
4. Launch **Kerbal Space Program** and configure your joystick through the gameâ€™s settings.
